    "# Abstract \n",
    "The objective of our project is to predict the usage rate of the Capital Bikeshare system in Washington D.C. Our analysis will be based on an hourly dataset containing weather observations (such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed), the day of the week, time of year, and the number of bikes rented in each hour. By analyzing this data, we aim to identify the factors that drive or inhibit bike rentals. Ultimately, we plan to develop a model that can accurately forecast the number of bike rentals for any given day or hour, provided we have information about the weather conditions and time of year.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve our goal, we will start by cleaning the data and enriching it with additional relevant features, such as precipitation. Next, we will train a variety of regression models on this dataset, and then select the model that performs best after hyperparameter tuning. Our evaluation metrics will be the root mean squared error and R2 of the testing set, with the model that produces the lowest error being chosen as the best performer. By following this approach, we expect to build a highly accurate model that can predict bike rental demand with precision."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The bike sharing dataset by capital bikeshare is a very well maintained dataset, with reports being published on their main website on a monthly basis<a href=\"https://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data\"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. It provides a selection of different variables that can be used to predict the amount of bikes that get shared on a daily or hourly basis, which makes it ideal for machine learning. This issue is relevant because figuring out the demand for these bikes allows bikeshare companies to provide a supply accordingly, and other stakeholders such as ridesharing or public transport services adjust their models using this information as well. Consequently, there have been some efforts on Kaggle to create models for this dataset, although these projects usually fall short in detail, since many of them forgo hyperparameter search<a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bike-sharing-demand/code\"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. While there are many that do not, they are constrained by Kaggle’s challenge to only use this specific dataset, which does not allow us to ask questions such as “Are bike rentals affected by rain?” Without relying solely on intuition suggesting this hypothesis to be true, further studies in Cracow, Poland reveals that there is a significant link between bike sharing systems and the amount of rain on that day<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2021.102724\"><sup>[3]</sup></a>. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we wanted to examine if the day and weather conditions had similar impacts on other vehicle sharing services such as Uber. Research has been conducted on this phenomenon independently through a study of Uber rides in New York and the weather, but it remains to be determined whether a similar or inverse trend will be observed when compared to the number of bike rentals during the same period since bikes and cars are usually thought of as substitute goods<a href=\"https://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings17/1260-2017.pdf\"><sup>[4]</sup></a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a paper by Gama and Fanaee-T makes liberal use of this dataset and tests out different modeling techniques for it, although designing an optimized model and minimizing errors was not the primary purpose of the paper<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259009057_Event_labeling_combining_ensemble_detectors_and_background_knowledge\"><sup>[5]</sup></a>."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The past decade has seen the rise of micromobility solutions, including electric scooters, traditional bicycles, and e-bikes, which offer a convenient mode of transportation for medium-length distances in cities worldwide. While these devices offer numerous benefits to users, their operation poses significant challenges to the companies that manage them. Maintaining an adequate supply of charged, operational vehicles to meet demand is critical to prevent lost profits and keep customers satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this issue, we aim to use supervised machine learning to predict the demand for the Washington D.C. Capital Bikeshare system, which comprises over 5,400 bikes. Our goal is to accurately forecast the number of bikes that will be reserved each hour and day, providing the company with sufficient supply to meet demand. To achieve this, we will leverage existing data on weather, seasonality, and rental usage collected in 2011 at an hourly and daily granularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantifying and measuring data extracted from weather and seasonal information have been shown to be reliable and widely used in many fields, such as weather forecasting. By quantifying and measuring our target problem and solution, we can expect reproducible predictions. Additionally, the dataset encompasses the entire two years, further increasing the replicability of our results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can use various regression models, such as linear regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine. For instance, linear regression can be used to model the linear relationship between features and target variable, such as weather and seasonal information, and predict the number of bicycle rentals for a given hour and day. Also, KNN and SVM models are good candidates to solve the problem because their ability to capture the variance of the dataset and handle the complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying the supervised machine learning techniques, we aim to build an accurate model that can forecast bike rental demand, allowing the company to optimize its supply chain and enhance its customer service.\n",

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We propose building regression models based on weather and seasonal factors from the dataset to solve our stated problem. Our solution will involve multivariate regression, K-NN, as well as SVM to model the relationship between the predictors and the response variable. Regression modeling is the most appropriate approach because our target prediction involves numerical values rather than classification. Our solution is applicable for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Multivariate regression: Multivariate regression is a popular and highly interpretable model for capturing the relationship between dependent and independent variables. Also, due to its high interpretability, we can generate a strong interpretable model if it fits well in our dataset. Therefore, it is a good starting point to model the relationship between the predictors and the response variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "K-NN(K-nearest neighbor): It is also known as a strong model that can be used as a regression  model to predict the target well if the dataset has a large number of observations and few features. The K-NN model tries to find the possible relationship between our desired prediction and k nearest data points that the model remembers. In our dataset, there are more than 17000 observations, while there are less than 20 features to consider to train our model. Therefore, K-NN will produce a good performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM(Support Vector Machine): SVM is a flexible and robust model that provides high performance in regression prediction. Also, it draws strong hyperplans based on the observations in the dataset to capture possible complex variable relationships. Therefore, it will fit well when it comes to all the different types of potential underlying variable relationships that we want to capture.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the performance of the suggested models, we will use k-fold cross-validation to estimate their accuracy on new data, and we will use grid search to optimize the hyperparameters of each model. We plan to implement the models using the sklearn Python library to ensure reproducibility and minimize implementation errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, we are confident that our proposed solution will work well for predicting bicycle rentals based on weather and seasonal factors.\n"

    "We plan to use both $R^2$ and $RMSLE$ as evaluation metrics to assess the performance of our benchmark model and solution model. Our goal is to create a robust regression model that can predict precise quantities of rental bicycles based on weather and seasonal factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In building our regression model, we understand the importance of using both $R^2$ and $RMSLE$ metrics as they complement each other in providing an accurate picture of model performance. $R^2$ measures how well our data fits our regression model, while $RMSLE$ quantifies the error between the predicted and actual values of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formulae for both metrics are as follows: \n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./Bike-Sharing-Dataset/output1.png\" width=\"70%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The plots suggest meaningful observations:\n",
    "1. As the season changes, the rental bicycle count also changes.\n",
    "2. Then rental bicycle count is also related with month, hour of the day, weather condition.\n",

    "2. The average rental counts vary depending on the time of day. During weekdays, people tend to commute between 7-8 am and 5-6 pm, while during weekends and holidays, they tend to enjoy their leisure time in the afternoon. Therefore, we observe higher rental counts during these periods.\n",

    "\n",
    "### EDA Conclusion\n",
    "#### The details can be also found [here](Bike-EDA.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The rental count of bicycles changes with the season, month, hour of the day, and weather condition. The dataset shows a significant increase in rental count during favorable bicycling conditions, such as during the summer and fall seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The average rental counts also vary depending on the time of day. During weekdays, people tend to commute between 7-8 am and 5-6 pm, while during weekends and holidays, they tend to enjoy their leisure time in the afternoon. Therefore, we observe higher rental counts during these periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. There is a relatively small difference between rental count on working day and non-working day, but we can see that on data points from working day there are more existing outliers. This suggests that the presence of outliers should be considered when building the regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The correlation heatmap shows that there are strong positive correlations between the target variable (rental count) and some of the features, such as temperature and humidity.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The count over continuous variables plot shows the distribution of the target variable for different values of the continuous variables. This plot indicates that temperature and humidity have a significant impact on the rental count of bicycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Based on the EDA, we can conclude that the problem can be solved using regression models. We can build a model that predicts the rental count of bicycles based on the values of the features such as season, month, hour, weather condition, temperature, and humidity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the EDA provides insights into the relationships between the features and the target variable, and helps us to identify the key factors that influence the rental count of bicycles. This information can be used to develop a predictive model that accurately predicts the rental count of bicycles, and can help businesses optimize their operations and resources accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Selection\n",
    "#### The details can be also found [here](Bike-EDA.ipynb)\n",

    "\n",
    "After feature engineering, selection, these are the final features that we build our models on. Also, it is worth noting that instead of manual one-hot encoding, we have categorized feature season, mnth, hr, weekday, workingday, weathersit. Therefore, these features are not treated as continous variables during modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, after dividing the dataset into training set and testing set, we transformed our target value with function log(1 + x) to avoid having negative values and huge difference between max and min values. \n",

    "<img src=\"./Bike-Sharing-Dataset/crop4.png\" width=\"70%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "From our default algorithm, Linear Regression, we have obtained 1.0836 for its RMSLE value and 0.1174 for its R2 score. We can interpret that our base model's predicted values are on average about 108.4% off from the true vales, and it explains only 11.7% of the variance in the data. It means that our base model has poor performance to capture the given dataset since RMSLE value is high and R2 score is close to 0. \n",

    "\n",
    "These are the training error/CV error curves based on RMSLE and MSE performance, respectively. Except for the green curve from the second plot, every other curve rather shows fluctuation in its error. Therefore, from the plots, we can understand that our linear regression does not capture the dataset at all no matter the size of training examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "It indicates that to improve the model's performance on the given dataset, it is crucial to explore other models that can deliver better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, we proceeded to investigate ridge and lasso models, which are variants of regularized linear regression, using various alpha values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is the plot of curves for the performance based on different values for alpha.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./Bike-Sharing-Dataset/output8.png\" width=\"40%\"/>\n",

    "Even though Lasso regression appears to be slightly better than Ridge regression, we can see that they both perform poorly on the dataset as their scores at most around 0.10. \n",
    "\n",
    "It introduces an idea that we need more complex model to capture the variance of the dataset, rather than linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is the basic KNN model, which can be a powerful model depending on the complexity of dimension from the given dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./Bike-Sharing-Dataset/output10.png\" width=\"60%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, it shows that KNN model has been able to capture approximately 80% of the variance of the dataset as well as brings down the RMSLE to ~0.19.\n",

    "\n",
    "Therefore, as the plot suggests, KNN model has shown the best performance to capture the information of the given dataset since it does not limit itself to linear regression. Also, we can notice that there might be more potentially better models as long as the models well understand the complexity of the dataset."
